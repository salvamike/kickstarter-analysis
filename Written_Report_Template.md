# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
For me there is two main purposes for this project.
The purpose of this project is to analize Kickstarter data, assisting Louise in fundraising for future projects for Kickstarter campaigns. 
Reviewing all data, and narrowing down to the solution and the best outcome for Louise by working step by step creating different 
tables and charts. And secondly as part of the purpose for me as a student in learning new abilities to work in excel  and learning how to create formulas 
and how to apply data in real life and real life scenarios.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this part of the challenge we were requested to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch date; specifically using the "successful," "failed," and 
"canceled" outcomes from Kickstarter sheet. In this section also we were requested to create "resource" folder which it will be also used further in the 
challenge. consequently I was introduced to learn a new formula YEAR() in order to diseminate data from “Date Created Conversion” column.
All this with the effort of separate all campaign outcomes to have a better view of campaign outcomes based on the launch date.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For this part of the challenge the idea was to apply all the skills learned throughtout the module and apply them to visualize and understand the percentage
of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. This was only possible by applying also a new function 'COUNTIFS()'. 
Filtering information on the Kickstarter "outcome" column, on the "goal" amount column using ranges created Less than $1000 all the way to $50,000 or more, 
and on the "Subcategory" column using only "plays" as the criteria.
After calculating each number of successful, failed and canceled outcomes, we were on the right direction to calculate the percentage based on the SUM()
of total projects from each successful, failed and canceled projects on each row.



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge I encountered was at the time of applying the function COUNTIFS() for SECOND PART OF THE CHALLENGE, since I never had worked with this function at all.
And figuring out each goal range based on outcome was extremely challenging for me. After reviewing several google articles and several 
training videos I was able to understand the application of this Function based on the information I had for me to work on.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on launch date I can draw the following conclusions:
A. that november is the month that shows more imporvement opportunity based on the quantity of opportunities 
by saying this I mean that there is more total of outcomes based on more available resources.
B. between March and May there is a huge gap in between successful and failed, which it results a point of interest for opportunity for improvement.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I conlcude based on the data collected that a play is more successful when  "less than 1000" and "1000 to 4999" is the budget, so therefore
a setting a budget between  "1500 to 2999" it seems to be a median budget to have a better Successful outcome compared to a more higher budget.
So based on this data, a higher budget does not neccessarily means a better outcome. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some of the limitations of this data is the lack of more detailed information that could help the analisys to be more direct and concise.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Perhaps other tables can be created showing based on different countries, and other categories and subcategories to be applied.
